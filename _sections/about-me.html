<p>I'm a senior at the College of Charleston, majoring in Computer Science and Computing in the Arts. My interests are in machine
    learning, AI, and graphic design. This past summer I worked in Germany for an artificial intelligence research agency.
    I've studied German for 5 semesters, in addition to taking a month-long intensive language course in Berlin. I am also
    the president of the Women in Computing club at my college. I love learning new skills and information.</p>
